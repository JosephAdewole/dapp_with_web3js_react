# Web3 Dapp with React and Web3.js 

## Features

1. Used Web3.js
2. Prompted user to connect to my dapp using their  metamask account
3. Displayed a user's account balance
4. Estimated gas fees for a transaction
5. Got number of transactions on an account
6. Get the network to which the user is connected
7. Displayed the account to which a user has connected the Dapp

### Next Steps

Next step for me is to actually hook into a smart contract from my react app and make transactions
