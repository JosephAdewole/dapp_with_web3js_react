# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What I have done

So far, I have ...

1. Used Web3.js
2. Prompted user to connect to my dapp using their  metamask account
3. Displayed a user's account balance

### Next Steps

Next step for me is to actually hook into a smart contract from my react app and make transactions
