# Web3 Dapp with React and Web3.js 

Goal is to achieve proficiency in web3 frontend dev

## Features

1. Used Web3.js
2. Prompted user to connect to my dapp using their  metamask account
3. Displayed a user's account balance

### Next Steps

Next step for me is to actually hook into a smart contract from my react app and make transactions
